# yelp_reviews

This is in response to the question posed about how I would determine the popularity of mexican vs. italian restaurants.

I used the yelp API to pull data and transformed the response into a pandas dataframe. It still needs a litte more finesse as it seems it only pulled italian restaurants but it showcases how I would approach the problem.
